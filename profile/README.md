# 🚧 Pota-Team 🧑🏻‍💻
Our slogan: <i>Pota an s'é de Berghém</i><br>
We are a team of 4 young (bad) programmers from Bergamo. We like polenta 😋 and tractors 🚜... and also screaming OL PEZZO 🤝🏻

Our members:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.github.com/andrearanica">Andrea</a>: the only one that has a readme on his profile</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.github.com/OlT1a">Mattia</a>: he doesn't know how to use threads and he likes museums</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.github.com/Jiplusplus">JiPlusPlus</a>: a guy that always asks for homework</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.github.com/olpezzoo">Stefano</a>: screaming his name is normal for us
</ul>
